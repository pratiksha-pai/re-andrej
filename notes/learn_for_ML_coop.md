skills
Neural Networks: Understand concepts like feedforward and recurrent networks, backpropagation, activation functions, and gradient descent optimization.

Natural Language Processing: Learn about tokenization, language modeling, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and sequence-to-sequence models.

projects:
Image Classification: Build a neural network model to classify images into different categories (e.g., cats vs. dogs) using popular datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet.

Sentiment Analysis: Develop a model to analyze sentiment in text data, distinguishing between positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, using datasets like IMDb movie reviews or Twitter sentiment analysis datasets.

Text Generation: Create a language model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to generate text in a specific style, such as generating song lyrics or short stories.

LLM projects
Text Completion: Build a language model that can generate completions for given text prompts. Train the model on a large corpus of text and implement an interface where users can input partial sentences, and the model predicts the most likely completions.

Language Translation: Develop a language model that can translate text from one language to another. Train the model on parallel corpora (pairs of sentences in different languages) and create an application where users can input text in one language and receive the translated output.

Text Summarization: Build a language model that can generate concise summaries of longer text documents. Train the model on datasets with document-summary pairs and create a system where users can input lengthy articles or documents and receive abridged summaries.

Chatbot: Create a conversational language model using techniques like sequence-to-sequence models or transformers. Train the model on dialogue datasets and design a chatbot that can engage in meaningful conversations with users, providing relevant responses.
