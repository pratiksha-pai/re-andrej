# hello again, we are going to build out makemore yay 
- get words from txt file, load it into an array 
- using bigram model, add a start and end token for each of these words
- youd use map inorder to sort it out in decreasing order - the bigrams 
- or beter yet use a 2d array, with row as first char and column as second char
- youd need function like stoi and itos to convert from string to int and vice versa
- 2d indexing for tensor looks like x[0, 0] rather than x[0][0]
- plt.text to plot out the text in the graph - for bigram to see the most common bigrams
- how to get probability of a word given a previous word? p/p.sum() for every row basically
- how to sample from a multinomial diistribution
-  clear out why we get diff answers for the same seed, [here](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&t=2036)
- how does multinomial distribution work?
- oh i think you need to follow the lecture while coding babe, i dont exactly know how to write out this skeleton here, ok bye, doing micrograd now
