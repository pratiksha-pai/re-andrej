### wavenet
- learn the broadcasting rules of torch 
- list [::2] - even elements, list [1::2] - odd elements
- how does view work in pytorch? - it is similar to reshape in numpy, learn how the arranging happens for 3d -> 3d
- // is integer division - 10//3=3
- squeeze - removes all the dimensions that have a size of 1, unsqueeze - adds a dimension of size 1, you can explicitly mention the dimension to be added
- what is wavenet? archive link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf
- what is wavenet defined as? - it is a causal dilated convolutional neural network
- why is cnn better than wavenet? - because cnn is parallelisable and wavenet is not, multiple intermediate steps are recalculated in wavenet
- torch.nn is a module that uses torch.tensor as input and output
- convnet
